    "Probability provides the tools to quantify and predict uncertainty. The theoretical foundations to which probability was created, relied on simple mathematical observations mostly from gambling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty is a fundamental principle in our daily lives and in the functioning of our society (e.g. will the market start a downturn or will it countinue growing?; will it rain tomorrow?; What are the odds of X team winning the championship? Will I get fired or get a promotion? Will I pass the course with an A or a B?; etc.). Probability has provided society with the tools to reduce uncertainty by mathematically estimating the variables that affect each event with the main goal of making reliable predictions over these events.\n",
