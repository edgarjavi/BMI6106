    "A contingency table is \"A statistical table that shows the observed frequencies of data elements classified according to two variables, with the rows indicating one variable and the columns indicating the other variable\". (American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 2009)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have two variables (outcome variable and the 'group'  or 'exposure' variable) and each of these variables have two possible values each (diseased/not diseased and exposure/not exposed), we can construct a 2 x 2 contingency table.  We call it a 2 x 2 table because there are two rows and two columns.  This is a subset of the R x C contingency tables (r rows and c columns). \n",
    "\n",
    "This type of tables are very common in epidimiology where the rows convey the disease category and the columns are the exposure category. The main goal is to compare the frequency of disease between the two treatments (in a 2x2 setting) which normally evaluates exposed and unexposed individuals."
