    "\n",
    "Since we have two variables (outcome variable and the 'group'  or 'exposure' variable) and each of these variables have two possible values each (diseased/not diseased and exposure/not exposed), we can construct a 2 x 2 contingency table.  We call it a 2 x 2 table because there are two rows and two columns.  This is a subset of the R x C contingency tables (r rows and c columns). \n",

The main goal is to compare the frequency of disease between the two treatments (in a 2x2 setting) which normally evaluates exposed and unexposed individuals."
